OVERALL PROJECT IDEA (IN SIMPLE WORDS)

Your project is a video-based intelligent Kabaddi analysis system that:

Identifies the raider

Monitors injury risk

Detects falls, collisions, and dangerous movements

Enforces Kabaddi raider rules

Works without wearable sensors

Produces annotated videos and alerts

All decisions are made using computer vision + motion analysis + rule-based logic.

🧠 TECHNOLOGIES USED & HOW THEY WORK IN YOUR PROJECT

I’ll go module by module, exactly matching your pipeline.

1️⃣ Video Input & Processing (OpenCV)
Technology

OpenCV

Why it is used

Read video frames

Resize / preprocess frames

Draw annotations (boxes, skeletons, lines, alerts)

Save output videos

In your project

Reads Kabaddi match / raid clip

Sends frames to all downstream modules

Draws:

Player bounding boxes

Raider highlight

Court lines

Rule violation alerts

Injury risk indicators

👉 OpenCV is the base backbone for video handling.

2️⃣ Player Detection (YOLO – Deep Learning)
Technology

YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model

Why it is used

Detects all players in each video frame

Fast and suitable for real-time analysis

Robust to occlusion and motion blur

In your project

YOLO detects all persons in the Kabaddi court

Outputs bounding boxes for each player

These bounding boxes are used for:

Tracking

Raider identification

Defender interaction analysis

👉 This gives the system awareness of all players in the scene.

3️⃣ Multi-Object Tracking (SORT + Kalman Filter)
Technology

SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking)

Kalman Filter (inside SORT)

Why it is used

YOLO detects players per frame, but IDs change

Tracking is needed to maintain consistent player identities

In your project

SORT assigns a unique ID to each player

Kalman Filter predicts player movement between frames

Ensures:

Smooth trajectories

Stable IDs even during occlusion

👉 Without this, you cannot analyze motion over time.

4️⃣ Raider Identification (Motion-Based Logic)
Technology

Rule-based motion analysis

Trajectory analysis

Why it is used

Kabaddi has only one raider

Raider shows distinct motion patterns

In your project

Raider is identified using:

Directional commitment (moving with intent)

Speed dominance (top 25% fastest)

Direction changes (dodging behavior)

Spatial displacement (moving from one side toward defender group)

All metrics are computed over a 90-frame window (~3 seconds).

Once confidence ≥ 70%:

Raider is locked for the entire clip

👉 This avoids confusion with defenders and stabilizes analysis.

5️⃣ Pose Estimation (MediaPipe – Deep Learning)
Technology

MediaPipe Pose (BlazePose)

Why it is used

Converts video frames into human skeletal joints

Provides body keypoints (hips, knees, ankles, shoulders, hands, head)

In your project

Pose estimation is applied only to the raider

Outputs 2D joint coordinates for each frame

These joints are used to:

Track movement

Detect falls

Check rule violations (feet crossing lines)

Analyze biomechanical stress

👉 Pose estimation turns video into biomechanical data.

6️⃣ Kalman Filter for Joint Trajectory Smoothing
Technology

Kalman Filter (state estimation)

Why it is used

Raw pose data is noisy

Small errors cause wrong velocity/acceleration

In your project

Each joint trajectory is smoothed using a Kalman Filter

Enables reliable computation of:

Velocity

Acceleration

Direction change

Joint angles

👉 This improves accuracy and stability of injury detection.

7️⃣ Joint Trajectory & Kinematic Feature Extraction
Technology

Kinematic analysis

Trajectory-based motion metrics

Why it is used

Injuries are related to how joints move over time

In your project

From joint trajectories you compute:

Speed

Acceleration

Sudden deceleration

Joint angles (hip, knee, torso)

Direction changes

These features feed into:

Fall detection

Impact detection

Injury risk scoring

👉 This is the core biomechanical intelligence of your system.

8️⃣ Fall Detection (Rule-Based, Video Only)
Technology

Rule-based fall detection

Inspired by CNN–LSTM fall detection papers

Why rule-based?

Explainable

No training data required

Real-time friendly

In your project

Falls are detected using:

Hip height drop

Torso tilt

Head downward velocity

Ground contact duration

Sudden stop after motion

Each indicator contributes to a fall severity score.

👉 This detects dangerous events, not just injuries.

9️⃣ Defender Interaction & Impact Detection
Technology

Spatial interaction analysis

Relative velocity & distance metrics

Why it is used

Many Kabaddi injuries happen due to tackles and collisions

In your project

You analyze:

Distance between raider and defenders

Defender approach velocity

Angle of approach

Number of converging defenders

This produces an impact severity score.

👉 This models contact-based injury risk.

🔟 Court Line Detection (Classical Computer Vision)
Technology

OpenCV

Canny Edge Detection

Hough Line Transform

Why it is used

Kabaddi rules depend on court boundaries

Lines are white, straight, and fixed

In your project

Detect:

Midline

Baulk line

Side lines

End boundary

Detect once from the first frame

Reuse for all frames

Draw on annotated video

👉 Provides geometric reference for rule enforcement.

1️⃣1️⃣ Raider Rule Imposing Engine (Rule-Based System)
Technology

Finite state machine

Rule-based logic

Temporal counters

Why it is used

Kabaddi has strict raider rules

Existing injury systems ignore rules

In your project

Rules enforced:

Enter defender court

Touch baulk line

Sideline restrictions

End boundary restriction

Illegal contact (hair/t-shirt pull – approximated)

Raid time limit (30 seconds)

Violations result in:

Player marked OUT

Alerts generated

Annotated evidence

👉 This makes your project unique and sport-aware.

1️⃣2️⃣ Injury Risk Scoring & Validation
Technology

Rule-based risk fusion

AUC (Area Under Curve)

ACWR (Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio – proxy)

Why it is used

Combine multiple risk indicators

Provide interpretable output

In your project

Injury risk classified as:

Low (0–30)

Medium (31–70)

High (71–100)

Validated using AUC

ACWR-inspired workload estimation using video motion

also created a raider rule engine where the raider is detected and court lien adn detected and if raider failed in any of the rules then he is marked as out and have alert to the user
the alert is sedn to the mobile app and using that app notification is sedn to smart watch which user weraed
